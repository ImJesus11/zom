Only affects dimensions with a day-night cycle!\n- Added a config option that toggles whether or not only a single Grue can spawn at a time (pausing the timer if a Grue is within 10 blocks of the player)\n-  Added a config option for the amount of damage the Grue deals when Wimp Mode is enabled (no, you can't set it to 0)\n- Added a config option for defining the minimum light level at which the Grue can spawn\n- Added a config option for defining the maximum light level at which the Grue can spawn\n- Added a configurable list of dimension-specific overrides for the majority of the available config options\n- Removed the Daylight Grue (with the config options for min and max light levels you can achieve the same thing)",
    "1.4.0": "- Improved the skylight calculations (eg. if you have hardcore darkness installed, it will be dark enough for Grues to spawn at night, courtesy of Laike Endaril)\n- The light detection code no longer takes artificial light into account (so Grues can spawn in the Nether, among other dimensions)\n- The timer stops ticking if you're already dead, as does the displaying of warning messages\n- The warning message is now displayed above the hotbar, instead of the top left corner\n- Added a loot table for the Grue (have fun trying to kill them, it's empty)\n- Added a config option to turn the dimension whitelist into a blacklist\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not to display the warning text in the chat instead of above the hotbar\n- Added a configurable grace period that temporarily stops the Grue timer for a few seconds on dimension change\n- Replaced the spawning sounds with new ones (with more genuine growls and more fake reverb)\n- Now runs on Forge 14.23.4.2705"
